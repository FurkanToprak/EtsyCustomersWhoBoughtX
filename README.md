# EtsyCustomersWhoBoughtX
This is a jupyter notebook script that I wrote for my family's business so they can identify customers who bought a specific item in the past.
This is useful for sending promotional emails or messages to customers who like a certain item.

# Dependencies
`etsy2`, an actually functioning Python3 wrapper around Etsy API.

# If Etsy is seeing this
For God's sake, stop supporting PHP for your API and actually release an official Python SDK.
